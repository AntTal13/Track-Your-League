# Description

Want to be able to see your league's current standings? How about the stats from your last game? Well, look no further!  

Track Your League allows you the ability to create your team's roster, add stats for your own players, and then see the current state of your league in our "Team Standings" page. Now you'll have a one-stop-shop to stay up to date with your team!

# Getting Started
Instructions  
1. Add Players to the League in the "Add New Player" tab
2. Click the "My Team" tab and add your Team Name
    * Team details will allow you to add players to your roster
3. The "Games" tab will allow you to see your current games
    * You can also add games here, showing a Win or Loss
4. Click "Stats" to add player stats to your box scores
5. Finally, "Team Standings" are updated with each Game added

# Common Questions

# Can I delete and update teams/players/games?

Yes, you have the ability, as the creater of a team, to delete that team from the website at any time. Players can be edited through the "Add New Player" tab in case of spelling errors, etc. Games may also be deleted in the event that a Win or Loss was not demonstrated properly.

# Can I view the website if I am not a user/signed in?

At this time, no. You may only interact with the website if you have an account with Track Your League.
